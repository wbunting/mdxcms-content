## What is MDXCMS?

MDXCMS is a way to generate MDX files as the content for your website outside of the main code repository. This leads to no-build changes for content (goal of CMS) but with the power to display custom React components (power of Code). 

### Setup

Before we get started we need to choose a backend. Here are some pros / cons:

**Github Pages**
- No API
- About a minute for changes to propagate to production. Hot reloading less feasible.
- Free!

**MDXCMS Hosted**
- Simple API for reading / writing your MDX files
- Instant hot reloading
- Eject to content repository if you don't like it (we don't want to lock you in!) 

### Module overview

You can add mdxcms to your project with

```
yarn add mdxcms
```

the module is structured like:

```
mdxcms/
├── backends/
│   ├── Functions to help fetch data from various backends
├── integrations/
│   ├── Opinionated integrations with frameworks
└── react/
    ├── some handy react hooks for things like hot reloading
```

### Integrating with Next.js

If you are using (Next.js)[https://nextjs.org] then you can use the pre-built utilities for data-fetching from mdxcms. Simply import onto one of your `/pages`;

```
// pages/index.js

import MDX from '@mdx-js/runtime';

import useCMSReload from 'mdxcms/lib/react/useCMSReload';
import withMDXCMS from 'mdxcms/lib/integrations/next';

const Docs = ({ mdx, etag }) => {
  useCMSReload(etag);

  return (<MDX components={MDXComponents}>{mdx}</MDX>)
};

export default withMDXCMS('github')({
  owner: 'wbunting',
  repo: 'mdxcms-content'
})(Docs);
```

The `withMDXCMS` is a function that takes a backend string, currently one of `'github'` or `'mdxcms'` to determine where data will be fetched from. The second curried argument are settings for where to find the data. Minimally, you need to supply the `owner` and `repo` on Github Pages that the `.mdx` will be fetched from. The current `pages/` will grab the corresponding `.mdx` file from the root of your content repo.

The `useCMSReload` hook is used to achieve a reload to check if there is new content on focus of the page.
