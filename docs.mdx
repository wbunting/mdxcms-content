## What is MDXCMS

MDXCMS is a way to generate MDX files as the content for your website outside of the main code repository. This leads to no-build changes for content (goal of CMS) but with the power to display custom React components (power of Code). 

## How to use

### Setup

Before we get started we need to choose a backend. Here are some pros / cons:

**Github Pages**
- No API
- About a minute for changes to propagate to production. Hot reloading less feasible.
- Free!

**MDXCMS Hosted**
- Simple GraphQl API for reading / writing your MDX files
- Instant hot reloading
- Eject to content repository if you don't like it (we don't want to lock you in!) 

### Module overview

```
yarn add mdxcms
